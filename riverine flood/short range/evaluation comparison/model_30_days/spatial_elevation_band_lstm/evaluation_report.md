# Spatial elevation-band LSTM: 30-day evaluation

Observed discharge targets were retained as recorded; missing targets were excluded from loss and scoring. Future reanalysis with lead-dependent noise is a stand-in, not archived forecast data.

Test years: 2022–2024. Flood threshold: 2494.714 m³/s (training Q95). Observed target pairs: 31932.

## Architecture and inputs

Each of four elevation bands has its own 365-day encoder and 30-day decoder. Area-weighted decoder features feed a shared monotonic quantile head. Rain, temperature, SWE and snowmelt are inputs to the history encoders; per-band rain and temperature reanalysis with lead-growing noise are decoder inputs. A same-source catchment-mean LSTM was trained as the spatial ablation control.

Weather bands cover 2015–2024. Training uses 2016–2020, validation 2021, and held-out test targets 2022–2024. The 2022–2024 period was inspected in prior workspace experiments and is not an untouched project-wide holdout.

NSE is not a percentage accuracy. These retrospective test scores do not establish operational forecast skill because realized reanalysis is used as a noisy future-weather proxy. Sparse flood observations also limit flood-case conclusions.
