# 30-day flood forecasting experiments

One model variant is trained and evaluated at a time. Three hindcast-forecast variants, the fine-tuned 30-day encoder-decoder ensemble, delta-HBV, calibrated physical HBV, both HBV residual corrections, the spatial elevation-band LSTM, N-HiTS and N-BEATSx are complete.

| Order | Model family | Status |
|---:|---|---|
| 1 | [Hindcast-forecast LSTM, including pretrained variants](Hindcast-forecast%20LSTM/README.md) | trained and evaluated; awaiting user feedback |
| 2 | [Encoder-decoder LSTM](Encoder-decoder%20LSTM/README.md) | trained and evaluated; awaiting user feedback |
| 3 | [delta-HBV, physical HBV and HBV residual hybrids](HBV%20hybrids/README.md) | delta-HBV, calibrated physical HBV and both HBV residual variants trained and evaluated; awaiting feedback |
| 4 | [Spatial elevation-band LSTM](Spatial%20elevation-band%20LSTM/README.md) | trained and evaluated; elevation-band model and matched catchment-mean control complete |
| 5 | [N-HiTS](N-HiTS/README.md) | trained and evaluated; awaiting feedback |
| 6 | [N-BEATSx](N-BEATSx/README.md) | trained and evaluated; awaiting user feedback |

The first experiment uses a reanalysis weather proxy because no archived 30-day weather forecasts were found. It cannot establish operational 30-day flood forecast accuracy.

Flood is defined as observed flow at or above the training-period Q95 threshold (2494.714 m3/s). Accuracy is overall across both classes; precision, recall and F1 are class-specific. The comparison uses 1055 matched observed day-30 targets from 2022-2024 (51 flood days). High overall accuracy is affected by the smaller flood class; flood recall is more informative for missed floods. Inputs are reanalysis proxies, so these are retrospective scores rather than operational forecast skill.
