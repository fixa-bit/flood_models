# Actual spatial model run

## Measured test accuracy

Lead-10 NSE is **0.853** for the elevation-band model and **0.867** for the same-source catchment-mean control (difference -0.0140). Parameter counts differ; this one-seed pilot does not isolate a universally transferable spatial benefit.

**Future weather is realized ERA5-Land with shared lead-dependent noise. These are not operational archived-forecast scores. NSE is not an accuracy percentage.**

Test years: [2022, 2023, 2024]. Observed basin-days across leads: **1084**; observed issue/lead/target pairs: **10795**. No missing discharge was filled or scored.

Peak/flood thresholds are training Q95 by default: **2494.71 / 2494.71 cumecs**, not official flood levels or return periods. Positive PBIAS means overprediction. False-alarm rate counts false alerts/non-exceedance days; false-alarm ratio counts false alerts/all alerts.

Six spatial and 20 existing synthetic tests passed. Tests establish code correctness, not accuracy. The original eight-input LSTM and earlier ensemble use different predictors and forecast-error models; they are context, not a matched ablation.
