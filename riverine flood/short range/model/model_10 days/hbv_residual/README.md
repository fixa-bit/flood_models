## Context

[Cross-model comparisons](../../../evaluation%20comparison/README.md) | [Original detailed notes](../../../evaluation%20comparison/archive/original_readmes/hbv_residual.md)

Saved evaluations use observed target days. Future reanalysis was used as a forecast stand-in in most LSTM experiments; these scores are not operational forecast accuracy.
