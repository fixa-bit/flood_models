- Lead 10 nse: **0.604** on the recorded observed test days. See the CSV for sample count and other leads.

## Context

[Cross-model comparisons](../../../evaluation%20comparison/README.md) | [Original detailed notes](../../../evaluation%20comparison/archive/original_readmes/hbv_lstm.md)

Saved evaluations use observed target days. Future reanalysis was used as a forecast stand-in in most LSTM experiments; these scores are not operational forecast accuracy.
